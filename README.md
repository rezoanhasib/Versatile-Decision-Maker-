# Versatile-Decision-Maker-
A self based Decision Making System 
The goal is to Design a program that will be used as a versatile decision-making system based on user input. 
There are several places where this application can be used-
An example is online Technical Support for a product or group of products. A series of questions might be asked and based on the answers, 
- a different branch of questions will be asked as follow-up-questions to determine exactly how to help the user. 
Another example is a telephone Technical Support, like a 1-800 number.
